ACMS Case Ingestion Overview
The ACMS (Application Case Management System) supports case ingestion through multiple mechanisms:

Linked Server

File Feed

Service Ingestion

Management of Cases (MOC)
Ingestion Method: File Feed

Validation Logic:

No mandatory field validation is enforced.

The system verifies:

Presence of both header and trailer records.

The presence of 23 pipe (|) delimiters per line to ensure structural consistency.

Processing Logic:

Although fields are not validated as "mandatory" per se, the application logic expects data for certain critical fields.

If any of these key fields are missing, the record is routed to Exception Cases and is not processed as a valid case.

CSU Cases
Ingestion Method: Linked Server

Data Source: Fetched from predefined database views via the linked server.

Processing Flow:

Case ingestion is executed using a stored procedure that inserts the data into the ACMS application.

No mandatory field validation is applied by the stored procedure.

Observation:

Analysis of incoming data from ART (presumably the source system) suggests that successful case creation depends on the presence of certain field values.

These fields, while not enforced as mandatory in the logic, are practically necessary for case creation to proceed without errors.

MSB Cases
Ingestion Method: Linked Server

Data Source: (Please complete â€” it seems the input was cut off here.)

Let me know which view or source MSB cases pull from so I can complete this section.

The xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure in SQL Server allows execution of command-line operations directly from SQL queries. Often, itâ€™s used to perform tasks like file manipulation, calling batch scripts, or accessing network shares.

If the commands executed through xp_cmdshell rely on:

Mapped network drives

Remote file shares

Services or scripts that use explicit credentials

Scheduled tasks or executables requiring authentication

Then the username and password used to access those resources need to be re-supplied after the password is changed.

âœ… Common Use Case
For example, if you're using xp_cmdshell to copy files to a network share:

sql
Copy
Edit
EXEC xp_cmdshell 'net use \\servername\share password /user:domain\username';
If the password for domain\username changes, the above command will fail unless updated with the new password.

ðŸŽ¯ Summary
Updating credentials in xp_cmdshell ensures that:

Access to external systems remains uninterrupted

File transfers, script executions, and automated tasks do not fail

Post-password rotation activities are fully compliant and tested
