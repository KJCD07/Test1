Removing .NET 6 Components from a Windows Server Running a .NET Application ‚Äì Detailed Explanation
Understanding Dependencies and Impact
Before proceeding with the removal of the following components:

Microsoft .NET Core Windows Server Hosting 6
Microsoft .NET Runtime 6
Microsoft ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle 6
it is critical to understand how they affect your running .NET application.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dependencies of These Components
üìå Microsoft .NET Core Windows Server Hosting 6
This is needed when hosting an ASP.NET Core application in IIS.
It installs:
ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) for IIS integration.
.NET Runtime 6, which is needed to execute the application.
üî¥ Impact of Removal:

If your application is hosted on IIS, it will stop working because IIS won‚Äôt be able to process .NET Core requests.
üìå Microsoft .NET Runtime 6
This is the core runtime required to execute any .NET 6 application.
If your application is compiled to .NET 6, it requires this runtime to function.
üî¥ Impact of Removal:

If your application is a .NET 6 Console, Windows Service, or IIS-based app, it will stop running.
üìå Microsoft ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle 6
This bundle includes:
.NET Runtime 6
ASP.NET Core Runtime 6
ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) for IIS.
üî¥ Impact of Removal:

If your application is ASP.NET Core and hosted on IIS, it will no longer work.
The entire web hosting capability will be lost.





 Step 3: Clean Up Residual Files (Optional)
After uninstalling, you may need to manually remove remaining files:

Open C:\Program Files\dotnet\
Delete any leftover .NET 6 folders.
To verify removal, run:

cmd
Copy
Edit
dotnet --list-runtimes
Ensure .NET 6 is no longer listed.
