Issue Summary: During the execution of an SSIS package, we received an error code 1326 related to xp_cmdshell. The specific error message was:

"Error Executing the query, failed with error code 1326 an error occurred during the execution of xp_cmdshell, call to LogonUserW."

This error typically indicates a user authentication problem, possibly related to incorrect credentials being used to access a network resource or execute commands. This situation has led to the failure of essential package operations that rely on xp_cmdshell.

Request: Could you please verify the following on the database server?

Check if xp_cmdshell is enabled - This is crucial for some of the operations our packages perform.
Review the credentials configured for xp_cmdshell use, particularly if there's a proxy account involved, and ensure they are correct and have the necessary permissions.
Confirm network access and permissions for the account on all specified paths and resources involved in the package.
