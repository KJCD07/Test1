Dear Team,

Moving forward, I kindly request that we perform the following checks on a daily basis to ensure there are no impediments for the development team. This proactive approach will help us maintain smooth operations across environments.

Daily Checklist:

Verify Autosys Job Status
â€“ Run a few representative jobs (batch/exe/SSIS/SP) in each instance to confirm smooth execution.

Verify Linked Server Connectivity
â€“ Check connectivity for both MSB and ACMS across all environments.

Verify Shared Path Access
â€“ Ensure shared locations are accessible in all environments.

Verify SSRS Reports Accessibility
â€“ Confirm SSRS reports are accessible without any issues.

To streamline ownership, please refer to the weekly rotation below for responsibility:

First Week of the Month: Mr. X

Second Week of the Month: Mr. Y

Third Week of the Month: Mr. CCC

Fourth Week of the Month: Mr. KK

In the event the assigned person is unavailable on a given day, the individual scheduled for the following week will take responsibility for that day's check.
Please note, there will be no changes to this roster unless explicitly communicated by Mr. XXXX and Mr. YYYYY.

ðŸ“Œ Action Item:
Kindly create a personal task/reminder to ensure this execution is carried out without fail during your assigned week.

Letâ€™s continue supporting our development team by being diligent and collaborative in these checks. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.
