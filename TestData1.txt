The initial daily ACMS-ICM Case Ingestion Recon Report includes key metrics to verify the ingestion of all parties from the original text file into ACMS:

Total Number of Parties Ingested – The total count of parties from the daily text file loaded by the operations team.

Total Number of Processed Parties – The number of parties successfully ingested into the Closure for Cause Case Manager and available for processing.

Total Number of Exception Parties – The number of parties that appear in the Closure for Cause Exception Queue due to ingestion issues.

Example: "No Valid Party Found" indicates that the party no longer exists in WCC.

Total Number of Cases Already Existing with Same Accounts and Parties – Cases where the same parties and accounts already exist in ACMS but with a different ingestion date.

Total Number of Missed Parties for Ingestion – Parties that do not fall into any of the above categories and require further investigation.

To better track parties that already exist in ACMS on different dates but also appear in the current day's ingestion report, an additional field has been added to the daily recon report.

The "Total Number of Cases Already Existing with Same Accounts and Parties" field helps clarify that these are not missed parties.

A follow-up email will include an attached spreadsheet containing the detailed breakdown of these cases.
